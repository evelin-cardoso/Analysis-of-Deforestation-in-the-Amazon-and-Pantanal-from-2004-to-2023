This project aims to analyze the deforestation trends in the Amazon and Pantanal regions of Brazil over a span of nearly two decades, from 2004 to 2023. By utilizing data from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), we explore the changes in deforestation rates, comparing both regions and visualizing these trends through various types of plots including line charts, bar graphs, 3D scatter plots, and interactive graphs.
